This program uses a greedy algorithm based on Adjacency Lists to find a coloring for a user entered graph. Simply Download, compile and run. 
Follow the prompts.
Feedback and suggestions appreciated. :)
PS: I know the prompts are irritating and time consuming while defining the graph. Will try to work on a random generator based on some user specs in the future.
